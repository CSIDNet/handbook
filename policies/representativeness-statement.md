# Representativeness Statement

| Version | Date Updated | Description of Changes           |
| ------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| 1.0     | Oct 21, 2025 | Ratified by Governance Committee |

**Purpose of Document**: To provide a succinct statement that will be read and reminded before making decisions to help improve representation across the diverse entities and individuals in CSIDNet to uphold the [core values of the Network](https://csidnet.org/about/). E.g., committee appointment and elections, funding support, invitation to discussions. Documentation of the process to help reflect on these decisions transparently is encouraged to provide opportunities for learning and accountability (not mandated).

**Statement**

At CSIDNet, we uphold a values-driven commitment to equity, mutual care, and just, context-sensitive collaboration. To move from intention to action, we must pause to think before key decisions who is included and who may be missing. Whether in finalizing committee appointments, structuring elections, allocating funding support, or extending invitations to speaking roles, we must actively consider representation across the diverse entities and individuals within our network. We recognize that no single group can cover the full breadth of diversity, and no individual can represent the entire depth of a subgroup. Nevertheless, we CSIDNet members commit to meaningfully include diverse viewpoints, positionalities, ideas, constraints, and concerns across CSIDNet.

CSIDNet strives for representation across multiple, intersecting axes of diversity, including but not limited to: geography and time zones; languages and cultures; race and ethnicity; gender identities and expressions; academic disciplines and professional functions; career stages from early-career researchers to senior practitioners; institutional contexts from grassroots organizations to academic institutions; and the spectrum from tool developers to end users. Representativeness matters because it ensures decisions are informed by those most affected while drawing on a wide range of expertise. This leads to more scientifically rigorous and socially relevant research and tools, strengthening our collective ability to address climate-sensitive infectious diseases.

By approaching representativeness as a deliberate and ongoing practice, rather than a one-time goal, we aim to move beyond extractive models of global science and foster authentic collaboration grounded in mutuality, care, and the principle that those most affected by climate-sensitive infectious diseases must be centered in CSIDNet’s governance and activities.

| Amendment and Review: The Governance Committee will review the Statement annually, following committee appointments and working group funding cycles (around December). Revisions will be led and ratified by the Governance Committee, with input from entities that used the Statement during the year. |
