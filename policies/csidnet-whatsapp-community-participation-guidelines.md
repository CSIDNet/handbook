# CSIDNet WhatsApp Community – Participation Guidelines

The CSIDNet WhatsApp Community is a space for Committees, Working Groups (WG), and event participants (e.g. AGM) to share quick updates and announcements. CSIDNet’s [Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15pvqtT6sDWQ5zt51uwCyIVesSLZq-MuFqge6r2MQRUI/edit?usp=sharing) applies to all community interactions, including WhatsApp groups. This document provides guidelines to ensure this space is welcoming and aligned with our values.

### 1. Communication channels

* Committees and Working Groups. Each Committee and WG has its own preferences for which communication channels to use and what type of information should be shared where. Please check your Committee or WG guidelines. In general:
* WhatsApp: short updates, announcements, reminders.
* Email: document sharing, feedback requests, decision making.&#x20;
* Staff support. Email [operations@csidnet.org](mailto:operations@csidnet.org) or get in touch with the Committee staff point of contact.
* Community-wide. Our listserv on [Groups.io](http://groups.io) is the best way to reach all CSIDNet members.

### 2. Respect and inclusivity

* 🌍CSIDNet is a global community. Please keep in mind that our community is diverse across geographies, cultures, languages, and communication infrastructure.
* Tone. Keep a professional, respectful, and inclusive tone.
* Language. Not everyone might feel comfortable using English. If necessary, use translation tools to support mutual understanding.
* 🐌 Timing. While chat-based conversations can feel very immediate, please don’t feel that you have to respond immediately, nor expect others to respond immediately. We’re all busy!
* Notifications. Configure your notifications to determine how and when you are informed about content.

### 3. 🔒Privacy & Safety

* Do not share members’ phone numbers, personal details, or group content without consent.
* Report inappropriate content or possible security issues (e.g. hacked numbers) to Admins.

### 4. When posting

✅ Do:

* Use the reply feature when responding to a specific post.
* Use emojis and emoji reactions.
* Add context for links. E.g. “Opportunity – Deadline Oct 15 – for early-career researchers”

❌ Avoid:

* Uploading heavy files. Share a link instead.
* Repeating announcements.
* Jargon.<br>
