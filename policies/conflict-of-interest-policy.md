What is considered a conflict of interest (CoI)?

We understand CoI as an emergent situation when a person or organization is involved in multiple

interests, financial or otherwise, and serving one interest could involve working against another.

<br>

A CoI can be financial, professional, and/or personal and can be with regard to an organization or person. All members of committees as well as CSIDNet team members are asked to report any CoI’s with respect to their engagement in decision making related to CSIDNet’s strategic partnerships and procurement processes.

<br>

In principle, any recruitment, hiring and procurement process should be executed in a competitive manner, unless there is a preliminary option that is favored due to the alignment of values and organizational strategy and superior competency in the required field of expertise. In such a situation, in order to prevent the entire competition from being a performative process, CSIDNet might partner with the service provider without going through a competition. However, the decision must be made in agreement with the staff and the related committee members.

<br>

If a committee member or staff has a potential CoI, they will be asked to recuse themselves from discussions and decision-making concerning the organization or person involved. Committee members ensure the network and respective committees follow a transparent and equitable selection process when the network distributes funds, fellowships and other resourcing. Members and staff  involved in selection and decision making about the process are asked to recuse themselves from reviewing proposals that present a potential CoI.&#x20;



A conflict of interest exists if:

1. The reviewer has a financial relationship with the applicant or the applicant’s collaborator(s).
2. The reviewer is or previously was in any form of mentoring relationship with the applicant.
3. The reviewer is currently collaborating with the applicant.
4. The reviewer is an applicant.&#x20;
5. The reviewer is affiliated with (e.g. employed by or a member of) an organization that is applying.&#x20;



Reviewers are welcome to reach out to the CSIDNet staff with questions about potential conflicts of interest. Selecting and decision holding members are asked to recuse themselves from evaluating or discussing proposals with which they have a conflict of interest. For other types of conflict, see [Conflict Resolution Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MkJ04tylU59dd0wtj3IOY55uOMcu5FQo82zwLqbzsX4/edit?tab=t.0) and the [Community Code of Conduct.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j2-KdBTIrEuAu8mVE30oXeMFy9OcE-CDsyCuRaLIFjE/edit?usp=sharing)&#x20;
